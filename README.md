# ‚öΩ Soccer Vision Analyzer - Player Detection and Team Classification

![Logo](data/logo.png)

**Assignment: Player Re-Identification in Sports Footage**  
**Submitted by:** Chaitanya Sharma  
**Task Chosen:** Option 2 - Re-Identification in a Single Feed  
**Submission:** PyQt5 GUI-based working prototype + documented insights

---

## üéØ Objective

To identify and label players in a soccer video such that those exiting and re-entering the frame retain the same ID. This involves player detection, tracking, and appearance-based Re-ID.

---

## ‚úÖ What I Completed

- üîç Used the provided YOLOv11 model (`best.pt`) to detect players and referees.
- üé® Classified team color (Red/Blue) using dominant color inside bounding boxes.
- üñºÔ∏è Built a PyQt5-based desktop GUI to load and process videos with real-time detection overlay.
- ‚ö° CUDA GPU support for smooth real-time inference.
- üñãÔ∏è Custom overlay including bounding boxes, player type, team color, and a transparent logo watermark.

## ü§î Why Re-ID Was Not Fully Integrated

While attempting to implement full Re-Identification (ReID), I explored multiple approaches:

- ‚úÖ Tried using DeepSORT ‚Äì struggled with identity switching and false continuity due to occlusion and re-entry.
- ‚úÖ Evaluated SportsReID (OSNet-based appearance matching) ‚Äì needed heavy preprocessing + large feature memory.
- ‚ùå YOLOv11 lacks native ID assignment; requires a robust ReID head or external embedding extractor.
- ‚ùå Visual appearance changes due to camera angle, lighting, and motion blur made reliable matching difficult.

---

## üß† My Learnings and Thoughts

- Re-ID in sports footage is a **non-trivial task** that demands:
  - A dedicated **appearance feature encoder** (e.g., OSNet, ResNet50-ReID).
  - Handling of occlusions, pose variation, and low-res crops.
  - Temporal reasoning or 3D pose tracking in ideal cases.
- **Color-based team classification** is a simple but effective visual enhancement.
- PyQt5 with OpenCV and CUDA is a great stack for building performant visual tools.

This video showcases the model's ability to detect and visually tag players with bounding boxes and team color classification.


## üß© Future Improvements

- Integrate appearance-based Re-ID using **SportsReID + cosine similarity**.
- Maintain a player feature memory and match new detections against it.
- Use keypoint estimation to further aid in identity tracking.
- Add export options (CSV logs, GIF clips, etc).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is an iterative prototype with room for expansion. The current version focuses on detection + visualization with initial steps towards team-based classification and lays groundwork for further Re-ID development.
